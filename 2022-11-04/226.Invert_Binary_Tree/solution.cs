//# Intuition
//When I saw this problem, I decided to swap nodes from the bottom, or child nodes, to the root.

//# Approach
//To accomplish my strategy, I should use recursive function to reach out to end of tree and both subtrees.

//# Complexity
//Time complexity: 83.90% O(nlogn)

//# Space complexity:
//14.67% O(n/2) since creating new temp node for the right subtree â€”>
